    <!-- Below is the code that was ultimately used in WordPress -->
   
    <!-- To add a banner to WordPress with Astra using the Block Editor first a figcaption must be added to the image using the editor. The page then needs to be saved. After it is saved the necessary classes can be added to the figure, image, and figcaption. Added the additional classes will result in the block being converted to a Custom HTML element. It is important that the caption is added and saved before the classes are added, otherwise unexpected behavior will result. To remove the banner the figcaption element can be completely removed from the now custom block, and should be able to add it back in again by adding it directly to the code block.-->
